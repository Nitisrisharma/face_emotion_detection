Face Emotion Detection
This project uses machine learning techniques to detect human emotions from facial expressions in images or real-time video. It can classify emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, and more from facial images.

Description
The project uses a pre-trained model to detect emotions based on facial expressions captured through images or a live webcam feed. Whether you use pictures stored on your laptop or the webcam for real-time emotion detection, the model analyzes the expressions and provides the corresponding emotion.

Due to the large file size of the model used in this project, the model file (models/emotion_model_svm.pkl) has been excluded from the GitHub repository. To use the model locally, please follow the steps below to download the necessary file and set up the environment.

Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
TensorFlow (or other dependencies depending on the model used)
You can install the necessary Python libraries using the following:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Setup
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Nitisrisharma/face_emotion_detection.git
cd face_emotion_detection
Download the model:

Due to the large file size of the model, the emotion_model_svm.pkl file is not included in this repository. You can download the model from https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml or from the original source. Once downloaded, place the model file in the models/ directory.

Run the application:

To detect emotions from real-time webcam video:

bash
Copy
Edit
python detect_emotion.py
This will open your webcam and begin detecting emotions in real-time.

To detect emotions from an image on your laptop:

bash
Copy
Edit
python detect_emotion.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg
This will process the image and display the recognized emotion based on the detected facial expression.
